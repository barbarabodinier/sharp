Title: Feature selectiOn and Clustering Using Stability
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Barbara Bodinier
Maintainer: Barbara Bodinier <b.bodinier@imperial.ac.uk>
Description: Implementation of stability-enhanced models for variable selection in regression, network estimation and clustering. These methods are based on resampling approaches to compute selection proportions. Calibration of the models is done via maximisation of a stability score measuring how unlikely it is that the selection procedure is uniform.
