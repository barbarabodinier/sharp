Description: In stability selection (N Meinshausen, P BÃ¼hlmann (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x>), resampling techniques are used to enhance the reliability of the results. In this package, hyper-parameters are calibrated by maximising model stability, which is measured by the negative log-likelihood under the null hypothesis that all selection probabilities are identical (B Bodinier et al (2021) <arXiv:2106.02521>). Functions are readily implemented for the use of LASSO regression, sparse PCA, sparse (group) PLS or graphical LASSO.
