Description: Implementation of stability-enhanced regression, dimensionality reduction, graphical and clustering models. These methods rely on resampling approaches to estimate selection (or co-membership) probabilities. Calibration of the models is done via maximisation of a stability score measuring the likelihood of informative (non-uniform) selection procedure.
