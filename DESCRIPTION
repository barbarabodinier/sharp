Description: Implementation of stability-enhanced models 
  for variable selection in regression, graphical modelling and clustering. 
  These methods are based on resampling approaches to compute selection proportions. 
  Calibration of the models is done via maximisation of a stability score 
  measuring how unlikely it is that the selection procedure is uniform.
