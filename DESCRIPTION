Description: Implementation of stability selection for graphical modelling and variable selection in regression and dimensionality reduction. These models rely on resampling approaches to estimate selection probabilities. Calibration of the hyper-parameters is done via maximisation of a stability score measuring the likelihood of informative (non-uniform) selection procedure. This package also includes tools to simulate multivariate Normal data with different (partial) correlation structures.
