Description: Implementation of stability-enhanced models 
  for variable selection in multivariate regression, graphical and clustering models. 
  These methods rely on resampling approaches to estimate selection (or co-membership) probability. 
  Calibration of the models is done via maximisation of a stability score 
  measuring the likelihood of informative (non-uniform) selection procedure.
