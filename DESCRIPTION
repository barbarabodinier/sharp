Description: Implementation of variable selection, graphical and clustering models based on stability. These models rely on resampling approaches to estimate selection (or co-membership) probabilities. Calibration of the hyper-parameters is done via maximisation of a stability score measuring the likelihood of informative (non-uniform) selection procedure. This package also includes tools to simulate multivariate Normal data with different (partial) correlation structures.
