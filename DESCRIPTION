Description: In stability selection (N Meinshausen, P Bühlmann (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x>) and consensus clustering (S Monti et al (2003) <doi:10.1023/A:1023949509487>), resampling techniques are used to enhance the reliability of the results. In this package, hyper-parameters are calibrated by maximising model stability, which is measured by the negative log-likelihood under the null hypothesis that all selection (or co-membership) probabilities are identical (B Bodinier et al (2021) <arXiv:2106.02521>). Functions are readily implemented for the use of LASSO regression, sparse PCA, sparse (group) PLS or graphical LASSO in stability selection, and hierarchical clustering, partitioning around medoids, K means or Gaussian mixture models in consensus clustering.
