abstract = { Purpose: We conducted this study because the duration of excess lung cancer risk among former smokers has been inconsistently reported, doubt has been raised regarding the population impact of smoking cessation, and differential risk reduction by histologic cell type after smoking cessation needs to be confirmed. Methods: The Iowa Women’s Health Study is a prospective cohort study of 41,836 Iowa women aged 55 to 69 years. In 1986, mailed questionnaires were used to collect detailed smoking history. Age-adjusted lung cancer incidence through 1999 was analyzed according to years of smoking abstinence. Relative risks were estimated using Cox regression analysis. Results: There were 37,078 women in the analytic cohort. Compared with the never smokers, former smokers had an elevated lung cancer risk (relative risk, 6.6; 95\% confidence interval, 5.0 to 8.7) up to 30 years after smoking cessation for all former smokers. However, a beneficial effect of smoking cessation was observed among recent and distant former smokers. The risk of adenocarcinoma remained elevated up to 30 years for both former heavier and former lighter smokers. Conclusion: The risk for lung cancer is increased for both current and former smokers compared with never smokers and declines for former smokers with increasing duration of abstinence. The decline in excess lung cancer risk among former smokers is prolonged compared with other studies, especially for adenocarcinoma and for heavy smokers, suggesting that more emphasis should be placed on smoking prevention and lung cancer chemoprevention. }

    abstract = "{Cigarette smoking is a leading modifiable cause of death worldwide. We hypothesized that cigarette smoking induces extensive transcriptomic changes that lead to target-organ damage and smoking-related diseases. We performed a meta-analysis of transcriptome-wide gene expression using whole blood-derived RNA from 10,233 participants of European ancestry in six cohorts (including 1421 current and 3955 former smokers) to identify associations between smoking and altered gene expression levels. At a false discovery rate (FDR) \\&lt;0.1, we identified 1270 differentially expressed genes in current vs. never smokers, and 39 genes in former vs. never smokers. Expression levels of 12 genes remained elevated up to 30 years after smoking cessation, suggesting that the molecular consequence of smoking may persist for decades. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of smoking-related genes for activation of platelets and lymphocytes, immune response, and apoptosis. Many of the top smoking-related differentially expressed genes, including LRRN3 and GPR15, have DNA methylation loci in promoter regions that were recently reported to be hypomethylated among smokers. By linking differential gene expression with smoking-related disease phenotypes, we demonstrated that stroke and pulmonary function show enrichment for smoking-related gene expression signatures. Mediation analysis revealed the expression of several genes (e.g. ALAS2) to be putative mediators of the associations between smoking and inflammatory biomarkers (IL6 and C-reactive protein levels). Our transcriptomic study provides potential insights into the effects of cigarette smoking on gene expression in whole blood and their relations to smoking-related diseases. The results of such analyses may highlight attractive targets for treating or preventing smoking-related health effects.}",

    abstract = "{Several studies have recently identified strong epigenetic signals related to tobacco smoking. However, an aspect that did not receive much attention is the evolution of epigenetic changes with time since smoking cessation. We conducted a series of epigenome-wide association studies to capture the dynamics of smoking-induced epigenetic changes after smoking cessation, using genome-wide methylation profiles obtained from blood samples in 745 women from 2 European populations. Two distinct classes of CpG sites were identified: sites whose methylation reverts to levels typical of never smokers within decades after smoking cessation, and sites remaining differentially methylated, even more than 35 years after smoking cessation. Our results suggest that the dynamics of methylation changes following smoking cessation are driven by a differential and site-specific magnitude of the smoking-induced alterations (with persistent sites being most affected) irrespective of the intensity and duration of smoking. Analyses of the link between methylation and expression levels revealed that methylation predominantly and remotely down-regulates gene expression. Among genes whose expression was associated with our candidate CpG sites, LRRN3 appeared to be particularly interesting as it was one of the few genes whose methylation and expression were directly associated, and the only gene in which both methylation and gene expression were found associated with smoking. Our study highlights persistent epigenetic markers of smoking, which can potentially be detected decades after cessation. Such historical signatures are promising biomarkers to refine individual risk profiling of smoking-induced chronic disease such as lung cancer.}",

abstract = {Recent technological advances in molecular biology have given rise to numerous large-scale datasets whose analysis imposes serious methodological challenges mainly relating to the size and complex structure of the data. Considerable experience in analyzing such data has been gained over the past decade, mainly in genetics, from the Genome-Wide Association Study era, and more recently in transcriptomics and metabolomics. Building upon the corresponding literature, we provide here a nontechnical overview of well-established methods used to analyze OMICS data within three main types of regression-based approaches: univariate models including multiple testing correction strategies, dimension reduction techniques, and variable selection models. Our methodological description focuses on methods for which ready-to-use implementations are available. We describe the main underlying assumptions, the main features, and advantages and limitations of each of the models. This descriptive summary constitutes a useful tool for driving methodological choices while analyzing OMICS data, especially in environmental epidemiology, where the emergence of the exposome concept clearly calls for unified methods to analyze marginally and jointly complex exposure and OMICS datasets.

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

 abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p ≫ n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

abstract = {Recent prospective studies have shown that dysregulation of the immune system may precede the development of B-cell lymphomas (BCL) in immunocompetent individuals. However, to date, the studies were restricted to a few immune markers, which were considered separately. Using a nested case–control study within two European prospective cohorts, we measured plasma levels of 28 immune markers in samples collected a median of 6 years before diagnosis (range 2.01–15.97) in 268 incident cases of BCL (including multiple myeloma [MM]) and matched controls. Linear mixed models and partial least square analyses were used to analyze the association between levels of immune marker and the incidence of BCL and its main histological subtypes and to investigate potential biomarkers predictive of the time to diagnosis. Linear mixed model analyses identified associations linking lower levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 p = 7.2 × 10−4) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α, p = 6.5 × 10−5) and BCL incidence. Analyses stratified by histological subtypes identified inverse associations for MM subtype including FGF-2 (p = 7.8 × 10−7), TGF-α (p = 4.08 × 10−5), fractalkine (p = 1.12 × 10−3), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (p = 1.36 × 10−4), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (p = 4.6 × 10−4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (p = 4.23 × 10−5). Our results also provided marginal support for already reported associations between chemokines and diffuse large BCL (DLBCL) and cytokines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Case-only analyses showed that Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor levels were consistently higher closer to diagnosis, which provides further evidence of its role in tumor progression. In conclusion, our study suggests a role of growth-factors in the incidence of MM and of chemokine and cytokine regulation in DLBCL and CLL.},

The comprehensive analysis of molecular association patterns and their changes in relation to different physiological conditions can yield insight into the biological basis of disease-specific phenotype variation.   Methodology Here, we introduce a formal statistical method for the differential analysis of molecular associations via network representation. We illustrate our approach with extensive data on lipoprotein subclasses measured by NMR spectroscopy in 4,406 individuals with normal fasting glucose, and 531 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (prediabetes). We estimate the pair-wise association between measures using shrinkage estimates of partial correlations and build the differential network based on this measure of association. We explore the topological properties of the inferred network to gain insight into important metabolic differences between individuals with normal fasting glucose and prediabetes.   Conclusions/Significance Differential networks provide new insights characterizing differences in biological states. Based on conventional statistical methods, few differences in concentration levels of lipoprotein subclasses were found between individuals with normal fasting glucose and individuals with prediabetes. By performing the differential analysis of networks, several characteristic changes in lipoprotein metabolism known to be related to diabetic dyslipidemias were identified. The results demonstrate the applicability of the new approach to identify key molecular changes inaccessible to standard approaches.},

 abstract = {The Lasso, the Forward Stagewise regression and the Lars are closely related procedures recently proposed for linear regression problems. Each of them can produce sparse models and can be used both for estimation and variable selection. In practical implementations these algorithms are typically tuned to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. We show that, when the prediction accuracy is used as the criterion to choose the tuning parameter, in general these procedures are not consistent in terms of variable selection. That is, the sets of variables selected are not consistently the true set of important variables. In particular, we show that for any sample size n, when there are superfluous variables in the linear regression model and the design matrix is orthogonal, the probability that these procedures correctly identify the true set of important variables is less than a constant (smaller than one) not depending on n. This result is also shown to hold for two-dimensional problems with general correlated design matrices. The results indicate that in problems where the main goal is variable selection, prediction-accuracy-based criteria alone are not sufficient for this purpose. Adjustments will be discussed to make the Lasso and related procedures useful/consistent for variable selection.},

abstract = {Summary.  Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

abstract = {Summary.  Stability selection was recently introduced by Meinshausen and Bühlmann as a very general technique designed to improve the performance of a variable selection algorithm. It is based on aggregating the results of applying a selection procedure to subsamples of the data. We introduce a variant, called complementary pairs stability selection, and derive bounds both on the expected number of variables included by complementary pairs stability selection that have low selection probability under the original procedure, and on the expected number of high selection probability variables that are excluded. These results require no (e.g. exchangeability) assumptions on the underlying model or on the quality of the original selection procedure. Under reasonable shape restrictions, the bounds can be further tightened, yielding improved error control, and therefore increasing the applicability of the methodology.},

abstract = {Although smoking and oxidative stress are known contributors to lung carcinogenesis, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. To shed light into these mechanisms, we applied a novel approach using Cys34-adductomics in a lung cancer nested case–control study (n = 212). Adductomics profiles were integrated with DNA-methylation data at established smoking-related CpG sites measured in the same individuals. Our analysis identified 42 Cys34-albumin adducts, of which 2 were significantly differentially abundant in cases and controls: adduct of N-acetylcysteine (NAC, p = 4.15 × 10−3) and of cysteinyl-glycine (p = 7.89 × 10−3). Blood levels of the former were found associated to the methylation levels at 11 smoking-related CpG sites. We detect, for the first time in prospective blood samples, and irrespective of time to diagnosis, decreased levels of NAC adduct in lung cancer cases. Altogether, our results highlight the potential role of these adducts in the oxidative stress response contributing to lung carcinogenesis years before diagnosis.},

ABSTRACT={DNA methylation, the reversible addition of methyl groups at CpG dinucleotides, represents an important regulatory layer associated with gene expression. Changed methylation status has been noted across diverse pathological states, including cancer. The rapid development and uptake of microarrays and large scale DNA sequencing has prompted an explosion of data analytic methods for processing and discovering changes in DNA methylation across varied data types. In this mini-review, we present a compact and accessible discussion of many of the salient challenges, such as experimental design, statistical methods for differential methylation detection, critical considerations such as cell type composition and the potential confounding that can arise from batch effects. From a statistical perspective, our main interests include the use of empirical Bayes or hierarchical models, which have proved immensely powerful in genomics, and the procedures by which false discovery control is achieved.}

abstract={Modern biotechnologies often result in high-dimensional data sets with many more variables than observations (n[?]p). These data sets pose new challenges to statistical analysis: Variable selection becomes one of the most important tasks in this setting. Similar challenges arise if in modern data sets from observational studies, e.g., in ecology, where flexible, non-linear models are fitted to high-dimensional data. We assess the recently proposed flexible framework for variable selection called stability selection. By the use of resampling procedures, stability selection adds a finite sample error control to high-dimensional variable selection procedures such as Lasso or boosting. We consider the combination of boosting and stability selection and present results from a detailed simulation study that provide insights into the usefulness of this combination. The interpretation of the used error bounds is elaborated and insights for practical data analysis are given.},

abstract = "This paper proposes to estimate the covariance matrix of stock returns by an optimally weighted average of two existing estimators: the sample covariance matrix and single-index covariance matrix. This method is generally known as shrinkage, and it is standard in decision theory and in empirical Bayesian statistics. Our shrinkage estimator can be seen as a way to account for extra-market covariance without having to specify an arbitrary multifactor structure. For NYSE and AMEX stock returns from 1972 to 1995, it can be used to select portfolios with significantly lower out-of-sample variance than a set of existing estimators, including multifactor models."

	abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},
