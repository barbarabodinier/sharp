## Description

> In stability selection, resampling techniques are used to enhance the
> reliability of the results. In this package, hyper-parameters are
> calibrated by maximising model stability, which is measured by the
> negative log-likelihood under the null hypothesis that all selection
> probabilities are identical. Functions are readily implemented for the
> use of LASSO regression, sparse PCA, sparse (group) PLS or graphical
> LASSO.

## Installation

The released version of the package can be installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sharp")
```

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
remotes::install_github("barbarabodinier/sharp")
```

## Example datasets

To illustrate the use of the main functions implemented in **sharp**,
three artificial datasets are created:

``` r
library(sharp)

# Dataset for regression
set.seed(1)
data_reg <- SimulateRegression(n = 200, pk = 10)
x_reg <- data_reg$xdata
y_reg <- data_reg$ydata

# Dataset for graphical modelling
set.seed(1)
data_ggm <- SimulateGraphical(n = 200, pk = 20)
x_ggm <- data_ggm$data
```

Check out the R package
[**fake**](https://github.com/barbarabodinier/fake) for more details on
these data simulation models.

## Main functions

### Variable selection

In a regression context, stability selection is done using LASSO
regression as implemented in the R package
[**glmnet**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet).

``` r
stab_reg <- VariableSelection(xdata = x_reg, ydata = y_reg)
SelectedVariables(stab_reg)
```

### Graphical modelling

In a graphical modelling context, stability selection is done using the
graphical LASSO as implemented in the R package
[**glassoFast**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glassoFast).

``` r
stab_ggm <- GraphicalModel(xdata = x_ggm)
Adjacency(stab_ggm)
```

## Extraction and visualisation of the results

It is strongly recommended to check the calibration of the
hyper-parameters using the function `CalibrationPlot()` on the output
from any of the main functions listed above. The functions `print()`,
`summary()` and `plot()` can also be used on the outputs from the main
functions.
