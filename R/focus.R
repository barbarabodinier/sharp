#' focus: Feature selectiOn and Clustering Using Stability
#'
#' Implementation of stability-enhanced models for variable selection in
#' regression, network estimation and clustering. These methods are based on
#' resampling approaches to compute selection proportions. Calibration of the
#' models is done via maximisation of a stability score measuring how unlikely
#' it is that the selection procedure is uniform.
