\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix with observations as rows and variables as columns.}

\item{pk}{vector encoding the grouping structure.
Only used for multi-block stability selection.
For this, the variables in data have to be ordered
by group and argument "pk" has to be a vector
indicating the number of variables
in each of the groups (see example below).
If pk=NULL, single-block stability selection is performed.}

\item{lambda_other_blocks}{vector of penalty parameters to use for other blocks
in the iterative multi-block procedure (see example below).
Only used for multi-block graphical models, i.e. when pk is not set to NULL.}

\item{K}{number of resampling iterations.}

\item{tau}{subsample size. Only used with resampling="subsampling".}

\item{n_cat}{number of categories used to compute the stability score.
Possible values are 2 or 3.}

\item{implementation}{name of the function to use for definition of the grid
of lambda values. With implementation="glassoFast", the function \code{\link[glassoFast]{glassoFast}}
is called and iteratively applied on possible penalty values until the constraint are verified,
i.e. that the expected density is below the value given in "max_density",
that the expected PFER is below the value given in "PFER_thr"
or that the expected PFER is below the number of selected edges if "FDP_thr" is not set to Inf.
Alternatively, this argument can be a character string indicating the name of a function.
The function provided must use arguments called "x", "lambda" and "scale"
and return a binary and symmetric adjacency matrix (see example below).}

\item{start}{character string indicating if the algorithm should be
initialised at the estimated (inverse) covariance with previous
penalty parameters (start="warm") or not (start="cold").
Using start="warm" can speed-up the computations.
Only used for implementation="glassoFast" (see argument "start"
in \code{\link[glassoFast]{glassoFast}}).}

\item{scale}{logical indicating if the correlation (if scale=TRUE)
or covariance (if scale=FALSE) matrix should be used as input
for the graphical LASSO. If implementation is not set to "glassoFast",
this argument must be used as input of the function provided instead.}

\item{resampling}{resampling approach. Possible values are: "subsampling"
for sampling without replacement of a proportion tau of the observations, or
"bootstrap" for sampling with replacement generating a resampled dataset with
as many observations as in the full sample. Alternatively, this argument can be
a character string indicating the name of a function to use for resampling.
This function must use arguments called "data" and "tau" and return
IDs of observations to be included in the resampled dataset
(see example in \code{\link{Resample}}).}

\item{PFER_method}{method used to compute the expected number of False Positives,
(or Per Family Error Rate, PFER). With PFER_method="MB", the method
proposed by Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010) is used. With PFER_method="SS",
the method proposed by Shah and Samworth (2013) under the assumption of unimodality is used.}

\item{PFER_thr}{threshold in PFER for constrained calibration by error control.
With PFER_thr=Inf and FDP_thr=Inf, unconstrained calibration is used.
The grid is defined such that the estimated graph does not generate an upper-bound in
PFER above PFER_thr.}

\item{FDP_thr}{threshold in the expected proportion of falsely selected edges
(or False Discovery Proportion, FDP)
for constrained calibration by error control.
With PFER_thr=Inf and FDP_thr=Inf, unconstrained calibration is used.
If FDP_thr is not infinite, the grid is defined such that the estimated graph
does not generate an upper-bound in PFER above the number of node pairs.}

\item{Lambda_cardinal}{number of values in the grid.}

\item{lambda_max}{maximum value in the grid. With lambda_max=NULL,
the maximum value is set to the maximum covariance in absolute value.}

\item{lambda_path_factor}{multiplicative factor used to define the minimum value in the grid.}

\item{max_density}{threshold on the density. The grid is defined such that the density
of the estimated graph does not exceed max_density.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if a message with minimum and maximum
numbers of selected variables on one instance of resampled data should be printed.}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to the functions provided in
"implementation" or "resampling".}
}
