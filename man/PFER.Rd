\title{Per Family Error Rate}
\usage{
PFER(q, pi, N, K, PFER_method = "MB")
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{average number of features selected by the underlying algorithm.}

\item{pi}{vector of thresholds in selection proportions.}

\item{N}{total number of features.}

\item{K}{number of resampling iterations.}

\item{PFER_method}{method used to compute the expected number of False Positives,
(or Per Family Error Rate, PFER). With PFER_method="MB", the method
proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2010) is used. With PFER_method="SS",
the method proposed by Shah and Samworth (2013) under the assumption of unimodality is used.}

\value{
The upper-bound of the PFER.
}
\description{
Computes the upper-bound of the PFER of a stability selection model
using the methods proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2010) or
Shah and Samworth (2013).
In stability selection, the PFER corresponds to the expected number of stably selected
features that are not relevant to the outcome (i.e. False Positives).
}
\examples{

# Example: 10 out of 50 features selected on average by underlying algorithm
# for stability selection with 100 iterations and threshold of 0.8
pfer_mb=PFER(q=10, pi=0.8, N=50, K=100, PFER_method="MB")
pfer_ss=PFER(q=10, pi=0.8, N=50, K=100, PFER_method="SS")
