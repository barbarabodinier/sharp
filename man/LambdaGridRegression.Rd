\usage{
LambdaGridRegression(
  xdata,
  ydata,
  tau = 0.5,
  seed = 1,
  family = "gaussian",
  implementation = "glmnet",
  resampling = "subsampling",
  Lambda_cardinal = 100,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdata}{matrix of predictors with observations as rows and variables as
columns.}

\item{ydata}{vector or matrix of outcome(s).}

\item{tau}{subsample size. Only used with resampling="subsampling".}

\item{seed}{used in set.seed() to ensure reproducibility of the analyses.}

\item{family}{type of regression model. This argument is defined as in the
\code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}} function from the glmnet package. Possible
values include "gaussian" (linear regression), "binomial" (logistic
regression), "multinomial" (multinomial regression), and "cox" (survival
analysis). This argument is only used with implementation="glmnet", or with
functions using the family argument in the same way (see example below).}

\item{implementation}{name of the function to use for definition of the grid
of lambda values. With implementation="glmnet", the function
\code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}} is used to define the path of lambda values.
Alternatively, this argument can be a character string indicating the name
of a function. The function provided must use arguments called "x", "y" and
"family" and return a list in which the entry named "lambda" contains a
vector of lambda values.}

\item{resampling}{resampling approach. Possible values are: "subsampling" for
sampling without replacement of a proportion tau of the observations, or
"bootstrap" for sampling with replacement generating a resampled dataset
with as many observations as in the full sample. Alternatively, this
argument can be a character string indicating the name of a function to use
for resampling. This function must use arguments called "data" and "tau"
and return IDs of observations to be included in the resampled dataset (see
example in \code{\link{Resample}}).}

\item{Lambda_cardinal}{number of values in the grid.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if a message with minimum and maximum
numbers of selected variables on one instance of resampled data should be
printed.}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to the functions provided in
"implementation" or "resampling".}
}
\value{
a matrix of lambda values with one column and as many rows as
  indicated in "Lambda_cardinal".
}
\description{
Generates a relevant grid of penalty parameter values for penalised
regression.
