\usage{
GroupPLS(
  xdata,
  ydata,
  family = "gaussian",
  group_x,
  group_y = NULL,
  Lambda,
  keepX_previous = NULL,
  keepY = NULL,
  ncomp = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdata}{matrix of predictors with observations as rows and variables as
columns.}

\item{ydata}{optional vector or matrix of outcome(s). If \code{family} is set
to \code{"binomial"} or \code{"multinomial"}, \code{ydata} can be a vector
with character/numeric values, or a factor.}

\item{family}{type of PLS model. If \code{family="gaussian"}, a group PLS
model as defined in \code{\link[sgPLS]{gPLS}} is run (for continuous
outcomes). If \code{family="binomial"}, a PLS-DA model as defined in
\code{\link[sgPLS]{gPLSda}} is run (for categorical outcomes).}

\item{group_x}{vector encoding the grouping structure among predictors. This
argument indicates the number of variables in each group.}

\item{group_y}{optional vector encoding the grouping structure among
outcomes. This argument indicates the number of variables in each group.}

\item{Lambda}{matrix of parameters controlling the number of selected groups
at current component, as defined by \code{ncomp}.}

\item{keepX_previous}{number of selected groups in previous components. Only
used if \code{ncomp > 1}. The argument \code{keepX} in
\code{\link[sgPLS]{sgPLS}} is obtained by concatenating
\code{keepX_previous} and \code{Lambda}.}

\item{keepY}{number of selected groups of outcome variables. This argument is
defined as in \code{\link[sgPLS]{sgPLS}}. Only used if
\code{family="gaussian"}.}

\item{ncomp}{number of components.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link[sgPLS]{gPLS}} or
\code{\link[sgPLS]{gPLSda}}.}
}
\value{
A list with: \item{selected}{matrix of binary selection status. Rows
  correspond to different model parameters. Columns correspond to
  predictors.} \item{beta_full}{array of model coefficients. Rows correspond
  to different model parameters. Columns correspond to predictors (starting
  with "X") or outcomes (starting with "Y") variables for different
  components (denoted by "PC").}
}
\description{
Runs a group Partial Least Squares model using implementation from
\code{\link[sgPLS]{sgPLS-package}}. This function is not using stability.
