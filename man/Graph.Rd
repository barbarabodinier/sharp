\usage{
Graph(
  adjacency,
  node_label = NULL,
  node_colour = NULL,
  node_shape = NULL,
  weighted = FALSE,
  satellites = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjacency}{adjacency matrix or output of \code{\link{GraphicalModel}}.}

\item{node_label}{optional vector of node labels. This vector must contain as
many entries as there are rows/columns in the adjacency matrix and must be
in the same order (the order is used to assign labels to nodes).}

\item{node_colour}{optional vector of node colours. This vector must contain
as many entries as there are rows/columns in the adjacency matrix and must
be in the same order (the order is used to assign colours to nodes).
Integers, named colours or RGB values can be used.}

\item{node_shape}{optional vector of node shapes. This vector must contain as
many entries as there are rows/columns in the adjacency matrix and must be
in the same order (the order is used to assign shapes to nodes). Possible
values are \code{"circle"}, \code{"square"}, \code{"triangle"} or
\code{"star"}.}

\item{weighted}{indicating if entries of the adjacency matrix should define
edge width. If \code{weighted=FALSE}, an unweigthed igraph object is
created, all edges have the same width. If \code{weighted=TRUE}, edge width
is defined by the corresponding value in the adjacency matrix. If
\code{weighted=NULL}, nodes are linked by as many edges as indicated in the
adjacency matrix (integer values are needed).}

\item{satellites}{logical indicating if unconnected nodes (satellites) should
be included in the igraph object.}
}
\value{
An igraph object.
}
\description{
Produces an undirected \code{\link[igraph:igraph-package]{igraph}} object
from an adjacency matrix.

\examples{
\dontrun{

## From adjacency matrix
# Un-weighted
adjacency <- SimulateAdjacency(pk = 20, topology = "scale-free")
plot(Graph(adjacency))

# Weighted
adjacency <- adjacency * runif(prod(dim(adjacency)))
adjacency <- adjacency + t(adjacency)
plot(Graph(adjacency, weighted = TRUE))

# Node colours and shapes
plot(Graph(adjacency, weighted = TRUE, node_shape = "star", node_colour = "red"))

## From stability selection output
set.seed(1)
simul <- SimulateGraphical(pk = 20)
stab <- GraphicalModel(xdata = simul$data)
plot(Graph(stab))
}
