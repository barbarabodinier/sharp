\title{Selection performance (internal)}
\usage{
SelectionPerformanceSingle(Asum, cor = NULL, thr = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{Asum}{vector (in variable selection) or matrix (in graphical modelling)
containing values of \code{0}, \code{1}, \code{2} or \code{3}.}

\item{cor}{optional correlation matrix. Only used in graphical modelling.}

\item{thr}{optional threshold in correlation. Only used in graphical
modelling and when argument "cor" is not NULL.}
}
\value{
A matrix of selection metrics including:

  \item{TP}{number of True Positives (TP)} \item{FN}{number of False
  Negatives (TN)} \item{FP}{number of False Positives (FP)} \item{TN}{number
  of True Negatives (TN)} \item{sensitivity}{sensitivity, i.e. TP/(TP+FN)}
  \item{specificity}{specificity, i.e. TN/(TN+FP)} \item{accuracy}{accuracy,
  i.e. (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)} \item{precision}{precision (p), i.e.
  TP/(TP+FP)} \item{recall}{recall (r), i.e. TP/(TP+FN)}
  \item{F1_score}{F1-score, i.e. 2*p*r/(p+r)}

  If argument "cor" is provided, the number of False Positives among
  correlated (FP_c) and uncorrelated (FP_i) pairs, defined as having
  correlations (provided in "cor") above or below the threshold "thr", are
  also reported.
}
\description{
Computes different metrics of selection performance from a categorical
vector/matrix with 3 for True Positive, 2 for False Negative, 1 for False
Positive and 0 for True Negative.
