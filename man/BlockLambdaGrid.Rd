\title{Multi-block grid}
\usage{
BlockLambdaGrid(Lambda, lambda_other_blocks = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Lambda}{vector or matrix of penalty parameters.}

\item{lambda_other_blocks}{optional vector of penalty parameters to use for
other blocks in the iterative multi-block procedure.}
}
\value{
A list with: \item{Lambda}{a matrix of (block-specific) penalty
  parameters. In multi-block stability selection, rows correspond to sets of
  penalty parameters and columns correspond to different blocks.}
  \item{Sequential_template}{logical matrix encoding the type of procedure
  for data with multiple blocks in stability selection graphical modelling.
  For multi-block estimation, the procedure is separately calibrating each
  block while the others are weakly penalised (TRUE only for the block
  currently being calibrated and FALSE for other blocks). Other approaches
  with joint calibration of the blocks are allowed (all entries are set to
  TRUE).}
}
\description{
Generates a matrix of parameters controlling the sparsity of the underlying
selection algorithm for multi-block calibration.
