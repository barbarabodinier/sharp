\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix with observations as rows and variables as columns.}

\item{pk}{vector encoding the grouping structure.
Only used for multi-block stability selection.
For this, the variables in data have to be ordered
by group and argument "pk" has to be a vector
indicating the number of variables
in each of the groups (see example below).
If pk=NULL, single-block stability selection is performed.}

\item{Lambda}{matrix of parameters controlling the underlying
feature selection algorithm specified in "implementation".
With implementation="glassoFast", these are penalty parameters
controlling the regularised model.
If Lambda=NULL, \code{\link{LambdaGridGraphical}} is used to define
a relevant grid.
For multi-block calibration (i.e. when argument "pk" is a vector),
Lambda can be a vector, to use the procedure from Equation (5) (recommended),
or a matrix with as many columns as there are entries in "pk",
to use the procedure from Equation (4) (see details and examples below).}

\item{lambda_other_blocks}{optional vector of (penalty) parameters
to use for other blocks
in the iterative multi-block procedure (see example below).
Only used for multi-block graphical models, i.e. when pk is a vector.}

\item{pi_list}{grid of values for the threshold in selection proportion.
With n_cat=3, these values must be between 0.5 and 1.
With n_cat=2, these values must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{K}{number of resampling iterations.}

\item{tau}{subsample size. Only used with resampling="subsampling".}

\item{seed}{value of the seed to use to ensure reproducibility.}

\item{n_cat}{number of categories used to compute the stability score.
Possible values are 2 or 3.}

\item{implementation}{name of the function to use for definition of the grid
of lambda values. With implementation="glassoFast", the function \code{\link{glassoFast}}
is called and iteratively applied on possible penalty values until the constraint are verified,
i.e. that the expected density is below the value given in "max_density",
that the expected PFER is below the value given in "PFER_thr"
or that the expected PFER is below the number of selected edges if "FDP_thr" is not set to Inf.
Alternatively, this argument can be a character string indicating the name of a function.
The function provided must use arguments called "x", "lambda" and "scale"
and return a binary and symmetric adjacency matrix (see example below).}

\item{start}{character string indicating if the algorithm should be
initialised at the estimated (inverse) covariance with previous
penalty parameters (start="warm") or not (start="cold").
Using start="warm" can speed-up the computations.
Only used for implementation="glassoFast" (see argument "start"
in \code{\link{glassoFast}}).}

\item{scale}{logical indicating if the correlation (if scale=TRUE)
or covariance (if scale=FALSE) matrix should be used as input
for the graphical LASSO. If implementation is not set to "glassoFast",
this argument must be used as input of the function provided instead.}

\item{resampling}{resampling approach. Possible values are: "subsampling"
for sampling without replacement of a proportion tau of the observations, or
"bootstrap" for sampling with replacement generating a resampled dataset with
as many observations as in the full sample. Alternatively, this argument can be
a character string indicating the name of a function to use for resampling.
This function must use arguments called "data" and "tau" and return
IDs of observations to be included in the resampled dataset
(see example in \code{\link{Resample}}).}

\item{PFER_method}{method used to compute the expected number of False Positives,
(or Per Family Error Rate, PFER). With PFER_method="MB", the method
proposed by Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010) is used. With PFER_method="SS",
the method proposed by Shah and Samworth (2013) under the assumption of unimodality is used.}

\item{PFER_thr}{threshold in PFER for constrained calibration by error control.
With PFER_thr=Inf and FDP_thr=Inf, unconstrained calibration is used.
The grid is defined such that the estimated graph does not generate an upper-bound in
PFER above PFER_thr.}

\item{FDP_thr}{threshold in the expected proportion of falsely selected edges
(or False Discovery Proportion, FDP)
for constrained calibration by error control.
With PFER_thr=Inf and FDP_thr=Inf, unconstrained calibration is used.
If FDP_thr is not infinite, the grid is defined such that the estimated graph
does not generate an upper-bound in PFER above the number of node pairs.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if a message with minimum and maximum
numbers of selected variables on one instance of resampled data should be printed.}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to the functions provided in
"implementation" or "resampling".}
}

\description{
Runs stability selection graphical models with
different combinations of parameters controlling the sparsity
of the underlying selection algorithm (e.g. penalty parameter for
regularised models) and thresholds in selection proportions.
These two parameters are jointly calibrated by maximising
the stability score of the model (possibly under a constraint
on the expected number of falsely stably selected features).
This function uses a serial implementation and requires
the grid of parameters controlling the underlying algorithm
as input (for internal use only).
