\title{Simulation of an undirected graph with block structure}
\usage{
SimulateBlockAdjacency(
  pk = 10,
  implementation = SimulateAdjacency,
  topology = "random",
  nu_within = 0.1,
  nu_between = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pk}{vector of the number of variables per group in the simulated data.
The number of nodes in the simulated graph is \code{sum(pk)}. With multiple
groups, the simulated (partial) correlation matrix has a block structure,
where blocks arise from the integration of the \code{length(pk)} groups.
This argument is only used if \code{sum(pk)} is equal to the number of
rows/columns in \code{theta} is not provided.}

\item{implementation}{function for simulation of the graph. By default,
functionalities implemented in \code{\link[huge]{huge.generator}} are used.
Alternatively, a user-defined function can be used. It must take \code{pk},
\code{topology} and \code{nu} as arguments and return a
\code{(sum(pk)*(sum(pk)))} binary and symmetric matrix for which diagonal
entries are all equal to zero. This function is only applied if
\code{theta} is not provided.}

\item{topology}{topology of the simulated graph. If using
\code{implementation=SimulateAdjacency}, possible values are listed for the
argument \code{graph} of \code{\link[huge]{huge.generator}}. These are:
"random", "hub", "cluster", "band" and "scale-free".}

\item{nu_within}{expected density of within-group blocks the graph. If
\code{length(pk)=1}, this is the expected density of the graph. If
\code{implementation=SimulateAdjacency}, this argument is only used for
\code{topology="random"} or \code{topology="cluster"} (see argument
\code{prob} in \code{\link[huge]{huge.generator}}).}

\item{nu_between}{expected density of between-group blocks in the graph.
Similar to \code{nu_within}. By default, the same density is used for
within and between blocks (\code{nu_within}=\code{nu_between}). Only used
if \code{length(pk)>1}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to the graph simulation function
provided in \code{implementation}.}
}
\value{
A symmetric adjacency matrix encoding an unweighted, undirected graph
  with no self-loops, and with different densities in diagonal compared to off-diagonal
blocks.
