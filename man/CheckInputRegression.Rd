\arguments{
\item{xdata}{matrix of predictors with observations as rows and variables as columns.}

\item{ydata}{vector or matrix of outcome(s).}

\item{Lambda}{matrix of parameters controlling the underlying
feature selection algorithm specified in "implementation".
With implementation="glmnet", these are penalty parameters
controlling the regularised model.
If Lambda=NULL, \code{\link{LambdaGridRegression}} is used to define
a relevant grid.}

\item{pi_list}{grid of values for the threshold in selection proportion.
With n_cat=3, these values must be between 0.5 and 1.
With n_cat=2, these values must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{K}{number of resampling iterations.}

\item{tau}{subsample size. Only used with resampling="subsampling".}

\item{seed}{value of the seed to use to ensure reproducibility.}

\item{n_cat}{number of categories used to compute the stability score.
Possible values are 2 or 3.}

\item{family}{type of regression model. This argument is defined as in the
\code{\link{glmnet}} function from the glmnet package. Possible values include
"gaussian" (linear regression), "binomial" (logistic regression),
"multinomial" (multinomial regression), and "cox" (survival analysis).
This argument is only used with implementation="glmnet", or with functions
using the family argument in the same way (see example below).}

\item{implementation}{name of the function to use for variable selection.
With implementation="glmnet", the function \code{\link{glmnet}}
is called. Alternatively, this argument can be
a character string indicating the name of a function.
The function provided must use arguments called "x", "y", "lambda" and "family"
and return matrices of model coefficients (see \code{\link{SelectionAlgo}}).}

\item{resampling}{resampling approach. Possible values are: "subsampling"
for sampling without replacement of a proportion tau of the observations, or
"bootstrap" for sampling with replacement generating a resampled dataset with
as many observations as in the full sample. Alternatively, this argument can be
a character string indicating the name of a function to use for resampling.
This function must use arguments called "data" and "tau" and return
IDs of observations to be included in the resampled dataset
(see example in \code{\link{Resample}}).}

\item{PFER_method}{method used to compute the expected number of False Positives,
(or Per Family Error Rate, PFER). With PFER_method="MB", the method
proposed by Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann (2010) is used. With PFER_method="SS",
the method proposed by Shah and Samworth (2013) under the assumption of unimodality is used.}

\item{PFER_thr}{threshold in PFER for constrained calibration by error control.
With PFER_thr=Inf and FDP_thr=Inf, unconstrained calibration is used.}

\item{FDP_thr}{threshold in the expected proportion of falsely selected features
(or False Discovery Proportion, FDP)
for constrained calibration by error control.
With PFER_thr=Inf and FDP_thr=Inf, unconstrained calibration is used.}

\item{Lambda_cardinal}{number of values in the grid.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating if a message with minimum and maximum
numbers of selected variables on one instance of resampled data should be printed.}
}
\description{
Checks if input parameters are valid.
For invalid parameters, this function (i) stops the run and generates
an error message, or (ii) sets the invalid parameter to its default value
and reports it in a warning message.
